1.1:
I get a thing that shows me only the Txt file, since it is the only thing in that folder.
This makes sense. It also shows me when I last wrote on it, the length of the txt file and a mode.

The Get-Alias tells me what command a shortening stands for. So it tells me the alias and the name of the command.

1.2:
There is a lot more going on when pressing detailed. It also gives examples etc. 

With the option of Attributes once can say to only get files with a certain attribute.

> GCI -Read Returns nothing. There's no read only files in here.

> GCI -Fi *.txt Returns the txt file. cool

2.1:

Current working directory is the shell magic folder. I am now restarting Power Shell in the bigger fold it is in.

I see the commands in yellow and some error messages in red. Otherwise I only see everything in white. The changing didn't do anything. I am now continuiong in Shell magic.

2.2:

pwd

sl  C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic

3.1:

My command was:
ni
[Path0] wd (I wanted to make it in the working directory)
[Path1] Hello World

This created two files as I saw when I ran gci. Also maybe don't include a space in a file name in general

3.2

PS C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic> ni -ItemType directory

Cmdlet New-Item an der Befehlspipelineposition 1
Geben Sie Werte fÃ¼r die folgenden Parameter an:
Path[0]: hello_world

3.3:

It didn't work because there already is a directory named this way.

> rni .\hello_world.bfe hello_world.txt
> gci

> mi .\hello_world.txt .\hello_world\

> mi C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic\hello_world\hello_world.txt 
-Destination C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic

> sl .\hello_world
> sl ..\

To check whether I was where I wanted to be I always used gci then.
It worked.

3.4:

The difference of moving and copying is that moving deletes the file from the original folder, while copying just copies the file and makes it again.

> copy .\hello_world.txt -Destination .\hello_world\

> copy .\hello_world.txt -Destination .\hello_world\world_hello.txt

3.5:

> ri .\hello_world.txt

> ri  .\hello_world\hello_world.txt

It tells me that it is a directory with different things in it. So it asks for confirmation.
If I really want to do it, I have to press yes. It then tells me I cannot do it since I don't have access.
