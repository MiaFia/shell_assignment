1.1:
I get a thing that shows me only the Txt file, since it is the only thing in that folder.
This makes sense. It also shows me when I last wrote on it, the length of the txt file and a mode.

The Get-Alias tells me what command a shortening stands for. So it tells me the alias and the name of the command.

1.2:
There is a lot more going on when pressing detailed. It also gives examples etc. 

With the option of Attributes once can say to only get files with a certain attribute.

> GCI -Read Returns nothing. There's no read only files in here.

> GCI -Fi *.txt Returns the txt file. cool

2.1:

Current working directory is the shell magic folder. I am now restarting Power Shell in the bigger fold it is in.

I see the commands in yellow and some error messages in red. Otherwise I only see everything in white. The changing didn't do anything. I am now continuiong in Shell magic.

2.2:

pwd

sl  C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic

3.1:

My command was:
ni
[Path0] wd (I wanted to make it in the working directory)
[Path1] Hello World

This created two files as I saw when I ran gci. Also maybe don't include a space in a file name in general

3.2

PS C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic> ni -ItemType directory

Cmdlet New-Item an der Befehlspipelineposition 1
Geben Sie Werte fÃ¼r die folgenden Parameter an:
Path[0]: hello_world

3.3:

It didn't work because there already is a directory named this way.

> rni .\hello_world.bfe hello_world.txt
> gci

> mi .\hello_world.txt .\hello_world\

> mi C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic\hello_world\hello_world.txt 
-Destination C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\WeekII\shell_magic

> sl .\hello_world
> sl ..\

To check whether I was where I wanted to be I always used gci then.
It worked.

3.4:

The difference of moving and copying is that moving deletes the file from the original folder, while copying just copies the file and makes it again.

> copy .\hello_world.txt -Destination .\hello_world\

> copy .\hello_world.txt -Destination .\hello_world\world_hello.txt

3.5:

> ri .\hello_world.txt

> ri  .\hello_world\hello_world.txt

It tells me that it is a directory with different things in it. So it asks for confirmation.
If I really want to do it, I have to press yes. It then tells me I cannot do it since I don't have access.

> ri -Recurse -Force .\hello_world\
One Drive somehow still would not let me do it. I therefore deleted it manually as Joska told me to.
4.1:

It gives me no output since there is nothing in the file whatsoever.
4.2:

> write file contents >file.txt
> gc .\file.txt

> write more contents >>.\file.txt
> gc .\file.txt
4.3:

> gci -Recurse C:\Users\es > home_contents.list gc .\home_contents.list

> write lol this is a line >>.\home_contents.list
> gc .\home_contents.list

The command oh -p makes the entire scrolling forever stop. It gives me the contents page by page with the option to exit.

5.1:

The measure-object command is similar to glimpse in R. It tells you the properties of an object.

No I cannot do that.

> gc .\file.txt | measure -Word, this works. Without the word it also does it but doesn't tell me exactly that it's 4 words.

It takes the contents gained by get content and then measures that. It therefore cannot access the file directly but only if it is "unpacked" before by the 
gc function. It does a similar thing by unpacking it first and then measuring it.

> gci | measure
I have four obejects in my working directory.
5.2:

It works in two different ways either in two lines with:

> write "hello world" > helloworld.txt and > write "world hello" >>helloworld.txt

or the other way in one single line:

> write "hello world" "world hello" >.\helloworld.txt

> sls "world" .\helloworld.txt 
It gave me the output of which lines the word world can be found in and how the line goes.

> sls hello .\helloworld.txt, .\worldhello.txt This is the command I used. It shows me where I use the word hello again by line and by which document.

gci also unpacks a lot of different data it doesn't show when it's executed, like Attributes, Working Directory, Exists, CreationTimeUTC, etc. This can be seen when doing gci|select and then going through auto-complete options with tabs.

5.3:

To find I did this:
> sls hello .\helloworld.txt

> gc .\helloworld.txt| sls world| measure -Word|oh -p

This doesn't change anything since the list is so small.

6.2:
This command resulted in an aup folder:
> tar.exe -xf .\aup.tar.gz
 
6.3:

Command: > gci -Recurse -Filter *.aup .\aup\|oh -p

Example:
C:\Users\es\OneDrive\Dokumente\UCU\LabcourseData\Wee
    kII\shell_magic\aup\cohort1\s010fint
Command:
> gc .\aup\cohort1\s010fint\s010fint.aup |oh -p

There are 964 files in the .aup folder. I used this pipeline to find it out:
 > gci -Recurse -Filter *.aup .\aup\| measure
